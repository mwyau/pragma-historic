  <LI> Free TCP/IP access among assigned computation nodes is

  <LI> Both in/out connection between the client and a front node

       It is not only the gatekeeper port (2119).

       The Globus session uses https connections of both direction,
       which are opened on arbitrary port.

  <LI> Backend nodes should be allowed to connect the client. <BR>

       NinfG processes launched on backends span callback connections
       to the client process.
  </OL>       

  <LI> Regular update of the AIST CRL file is required.<BR>

       For those CRL savvy sites, the AIST CRL file has to be updated
       regularly, or the globus access with the AIST certificate is 
       impossible.

       The latest CRL file will be found at: <A
       HREF="https://www.apgrid.org/CA/AIST/Production/a317c467.r0">
       https://www.apgrid.org/CA/AIST/Production/a317c467.r0</A>.

       It is updated on every 30 - alpha days, which makes the
       requirement troublesome.

       An automatic update mechanism are now under consideration.

  <LI> It is desirable for a local queue system to allow exclusive use
       of backend nodes.<BR>

       The solution is mostly case-by-case, twicking both the queue
       and jobmanager configurations.

<H2><A NAME="App"> About GridFMO </A></H2>
<H3> Application </H3>
<P>

GridFMO is a Grid version of the Fragment Molecular Orbital (FMO)
calculation.

FMO method enables a first-principle calculation of macromolecules
such as proteins.

Thanks to the first-principle nature of the FMO method, an energy of
the molecules is obtained accurately (including polarization effect),
and their chemical reactions can be described with few assumptions.

The FMO method is now used to study a reaction mechanism of enzymes,
an electronic structure of the photosynthetic systems, and so on.

</P>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<H3> Implementation </H3>
<P>

In the FMO method, the electronic state of the whole molecule is
calculated by splitting it into small fragments.

The electronic state of each fragment is calculated under the
electrostatic environment posed by the other fragments.

The environment is then reconstructed from the calculated electronic
states, so that the calculation should be iterated to the
self-consistency.

To improve the accuracy, the electronic states of the fragment pairs
are also calculated after the convergence.

</P>
<P>

Each electronic state calculation can be performed independently under
the given environment.

This is the source of the "Grid" in the GridFMO calculation.

Those calculation processes are spawned on remote machines by using
Ninf-G2 (or SSH), which may run further in parallel.

For the fine-grained parallel execution, the DDI library of GAMESS is
utilized, where the free TCP/IP access among computation nodes becomes
necessary.

</P>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<H3> Planned experiment </H3>
<P>

We are planning to draw potential energy curves of proteins.

A number of GridFMO calculations should be run to draw a curve, which
will be performed on the PRAGMA testbed.

In order to reduce inactivity during the serial part of the GridFMO
calculation, it will be tested to share the assigned computational
resources among two or more GridFMO processes.

GridFMO is implemented with fault-tolerance, where faults are detected
automatically while recoveries are done manually.

Feasibility of the model will also be assessed in the experiment.

</P>

<H2><A NAME="Remark"> Remarks </A></H2>
<OL>
<LI> In some cluster machines, each computation node has two network
     cards, one is public and another is private.  The official
     hostname of the node may be bound to the public IP address, which
     is tightly gurded by a firewall.  If this is the case, please
     tell us to use the private address.
