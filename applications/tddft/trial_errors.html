Test
------------------------------------------------------------------
- Globus-level test
  - authentication test
      % globusrun -a -r HOST
    If it failed, check HOST certificate, CA certificate and CA CRL.

  - use jobmanager-fork
      % globus-job-run HOST/jobmanager-fork /bin/hostname

  - use jobmanager-{pbs/sge/sqms}
      % globus-job-run HOST/jobmanager-pbs -np 4 /bin/hostname
    If it failed or it was blocked, login to the server and check
    status of the job.



Troubleshooting
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 07/21/04

Problem:
  A PBS job failed and it was queued due to unknown error.
  Also, I could not login to agt-cn04.

Cause:
  The agt-cn04 was down.

Solution:
  Administrator rebooted agt-cn04.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 07/20/04

Problem:
  $ globus-job-run agt-login.ncsa.uiuc.edu/jobmanager-pbs -np 2 -q pragma /bin/hostname
  GRAM Job submission failed because the provided RSL 'queue' parameter is invalid (error 

code 37)

Cause:
  (Probably) After performing setup-globus-gram-job-manager-pbs, queue configuration of pbs
  was modified.

Solution:
  Administrator modified /usr/local/globus/share/globus_gram_job_manager/pbs.rv file.
   (Before)
      Attribute: queue
      Values: workq
   (After)
      Attribute: queue
      Values: pragma
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 07/16/04

Problem: globus-job-run failed at authentication.

Cause: Installed CRL of AIST GTRC CA was expired.

Solution:  Adiministrator updated the CRL file.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 07/11/04

Problem:
  $ globus-job-run agt-login.ncsa.uiuc.edu/jobmanager-pbs -np 1 /bin/hostname
  agt-cn07.ncsa.uiuc.edu
  id: cannot find name for group ID 547

Cause: /etc/group file was not consistent between a frontend and compute nodes.

Solution: Administrator copied /etc/group file on the frontend to others.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 07/06/04

Problem:
  I could not login to agt-login.

  $ ssh -2 -v -l tanisuke agt-login.ncsa.uiuc.edu

  GSSAPI Error:

  GSS Minor Status Error Chain: 
  an unknown error occurred
  Disconnecting: Protocol error: didn't expect packet type 34
  debug1: Calling cleanup 0x8068228(0x0)

Cause:
  ssh was GSI-enabled ssh and the error occured in GSI authentication.
  GSI-enabled ssh did not try access with ssh public key.

Solution:
  I used /usr/bin/ssh.
  Or administrator added my DN to /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 07/05/04 

Problem:
  `globus-job-run ase.nchc.org.tw/jobmanager-pbs -np 2 /bin/hostname` failed.
  I could not login to ase-1 too.
    $ ssh ase-1
    Connection to ase-1 closed by remote host.
    Connection to ase-1 closed.

Cause:
  A NIS map was not updated.

Solution:
  Administrator updated the NIS map.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: ---

Problem:  `globus-job-run gsic-presto.titech.hpcc.jp/jobmanager-pbs -np 1 failed.
          The job was left in the queue.

Cause:  rcp was disabled.

Solution:  A NIS map configuration was something wrong.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: ---

Problem:  Multiple jobs which were submitted through globus's jobmanager-sge were assigned to 

the same host.

Cause:  jobmanager-sge script that is included in jobmanager-setup package has some bugs.

Solution:  AIST GTRC provides another jobmanager-sge script to solve the problem.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: ---

Problem:  TDDFT program compiled with ifc 8.0 failed (Segmentation fault).

Cause:  Stack size was limited.

Solution:  User set unlimited stack size in shell environment or in his/her program.
             Ex. $ ulimit -s unlimited
             Ex. call setrlimit()
