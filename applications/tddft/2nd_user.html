Summary:
-------
All application setups are done by Yusuke. (Only AIST has access to TDDFT code.)
Yusuke initially tried to setup TDDFT on crayon (SDSC),
we experienced various problems (detail report below).
There are many differences between UME (AIST) and crayon (SDSC),
IFC versions, local ninf-g installations and environmental setups etc.
which maybe the sources of our problems.
Since our main objective is not porting the application,
while we are still looking into solutions to this,
Yusuke also setup TDDFT in my account on UME and I was able to start the run there.
Currently, I'm running TDDFT on 6 sites:
ume (AIST, Japan) 
crayon (SDSC, USA) 
amata1 (KU, Thailand)
agt (NCSA, USA)
jupiter (KISTI, Korea)
ase (NCHC, Taiwan)

Detail log:
----------

8/27/04 PST
Previous run stopped output - client0824.out
Jobs were still running on ume, agt-login, crayon, ase.
Deleted jobs from queues.
Cannot logon to jupiter and amata1.

8/24/04 PST
Trial:
ninf-g servers: 
Error:  Output stopped 8/24/04 10:40am PST
client: ngclExecutable.c:5565: ngcllExecutableGet: Assertion `executable->nge_ID >= 0' failed.
** Signal 134525688 **
Note: probably due to NCSA maintenance on agt-login
jobs still running in the queues on crayon, ume, ase, jupiter
network connection to amata1 broke at gb-cpec4k6-cpec6k.cpe.ku.ac.th
job killed on agt
Solution:

8/23/04 PST
Trial: run from ume
ninf-g servers: malicia

Note: globus authentication test and jobmanager test passed
Solution:

8/21/04 PST
Trial: job terminated with error at ~5pm
ninf-g servers: ume, crayon, amata1, agt-login, jupiter, ase
Error: "Internal inconsistency detected" in stderr by application
Note: jobs status on each systems as
      ume: Eqw
      crayon: Eqw
      ase: no job
      amata1: run
      jupiter: no job
      agt: no job
Solutions: restarted on 8/23/04 PST

8/20/04 PST
Trial: changed jobmanager from fork to pbs for NCHC, 
       restart TDDFT from ume
ninf-g servers: ume, crayon, amata1, agt-login, jupiter, ase
Error: job queued, not run
Note: 
Solutions: setup passwordless access to compute nodes
           Julian enabled ssh1 access on ase

8/18/04 PST
Trial: added NCHC system ase to TDDFT run
ninf-g servers: ume, crayon, amata1, agt-login, jupiter, ase
Error: None
Note: When kill previous runs, sometime need manually cleanup
Solutions: 

8/17/04 PST
Trial: added KISTI system Jupiter to TDDFT run
ninf-g servers: ume, crayon, amata1, agt-login, jupiter
Error: None
Note: Previously had problem to access jupiter.
      Jupiter use non-standard port# for gsissh.
Solution: Specify port# when run gsissh and then TDDFT connection problem went away.


8/14/04 PST
Trial: changed mpich allocation rule from $round_robin to $fill_up
ninf-g servers: ume, crayon, amata1, agt-login
Error: qstat shows TDDFT job is at the state of ewq
Note: Yusuke cannot start TDDFT on crayon.
      tested job start with her run, 2 succeeded and 2 failed.
      Seems that TDDFT prefer $round_robin allocation.
      Perhaps due to its high memory usage?
Solution: Reset mpich allocation rule to $round_robin on crayon.
          Restart TDDFT job.

8/13/04 PST
Trial: killed TDDFT run and restart
ninf-g servers: ume, crayon, amata1, agt-login
Error: hang at job initialization
Solution: manually clean up processes on ume and manually delete jobs on amata1

8/11/04 PST
Trial: ran TDDFT from ume
ninf-g servers: ume, crayon, amata1, agt-login

       hpsi_queue: GRPC fails on initialization call.
Note: 
Solution: Yusuke corrected a permission problem in his home dir on agt-login

8/9/04 PST
Trial: checked the run started on 8/5/04
ninf-g servers: UME, crayon, amata1
Error: Tue Aug 10 04:49:26 2004 621ms 151us: Client: ume.hpcc.jp: Error: Context 1: grpc_invoke_async_np: Failed to Session start.

       (cut)
       hpsi_queue: Internal inconsistency detected.
       hpsi_queue_free: 11 stubs were found to be down.      
Note: Probably due to temporary change of .ssh/iden* files in /home/zhengc on crayon
      and low fault tolerancy.
Solution: Kill processes and restart

8/5/04 PST
Trial: ran TDDFT from UME
ninf-g servers: UME, crayon, amata1
Error:
Note: last checked Tue Aug 10 02:26:42 JST 2004, running normally

Trial: checked the run which was started yesterday on ume
ninf-g servers: UME, crayon, amata1
error: The job stopped writing to its output file ~14 hours after it started
Note: qstat on all systems showed jobs running normally
Solution: Killed the processes

Trial: tested the run with additional sites 
ninf-g servers: jupiter, aurora, agt-login
Error: hang or errors
Note: NCSA - job submission problem
      USM - network or access problem
      KISTI - network or access problem
      TITECH - account setup problem
      NCHC - account setup problem
      BII - account access problem
