Yusuke,

I'm attaching the sge.in file that we used based on AIST's jobmanager- 
sge gpt bundle.  The changes for GT4/SGE6 were to place the env  
variables related to SGE in the sge.pm (sge.in from the bundle).  I'm  
not sure if this is related to the changes you will need since we  
made the jump from gt2->gt4 and sge5->sge6 at the same time.  This  
may be an SGE6 issue only.

In either case, we are very interested in what your sge.pm file will  
end up looking like, so we can make sure both of us have similar  
configurations.  Thanks.

	-mjk
