A Gfarm meta-server rocks-144.sdsc.edu has been setup for our testbed Gfarm
system. All testbed clusters can become our Gfarm file system nodes by
installing Gfarm file system and client software.
<UL>
<LI><h3>Requirements</h3>
<UL>
<LI> Public IP for each nodes (Gfarm developers are working on to include
network addresss translation in future versions in order to allow private
IP compute nodes to become Gfarm file system nodes)
<LI> Open TCP/UDP ports 600 for both front-end and compute nodes
<LI> OpenSSL library
<LI> OpenLDAP library
</UL>
<p>
<LI><h3>Installation</h3>
Because most of our sites are running SCMSWeb, we need a special version of
gfarm.spec file to build Gfarm RPMs to avoid a conflict. This means that
we need to start with source RPM for Gfarm installation. Here are the steps:
<OL>
<p>
<LI> Download the <a href="../../softdepot/gfarm-1.2-5p.src.rpm">source RPM</a>
<p>
<LI> Follow the <a href="http://datafarm.apgrid.org/software/binary-rpm.html">instructions</a> 
to create binary RPMs
<p>
<LI>This step is for gfarm upgrade. If this is a fresh-install, skip to step 4.
<br><br>If you are performing an upgrade on a gfarm file system node, 
copy the binary rpm files you just created in step 2 to a location where all compute node can access,
then do the following steps on each compute node
<pre>
# service gfsd stop
# killall gfarm_agent
# rpm -Fvh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/gfarm-gsi-*
# service gfsd start
</pre>
Skip the rest of the steps - you are done.
<p>
<LI><a href="http://datafarm.apgrid.org/software/syscall-hook.en.html">find</a>
and download the glibc-not-hidden for your system
<p>
<LI> Download the <a href="../../secure/gfarm.conf">gfarm.conf</a> file for our testbed Gfarm meta-server.
<p>
<LI>To install Gfarm binary RPMs you just created and the glibc-not-hidden package, follow the 
<a href="http://datafarm.apgrid.org/software/1.1.1/INSTALL.RPM.en.txt">Gfarm installation manual</a>, 
<font color="red">but skip directly to the session "Configuration of Gfarm file system node (and client node)" and make sure that you replace the "gfms.apgrid.org:/etc/gfarm.conf" in the scp command with the path of the gfarm.conf file you just downloaded in step 5!</font>
<p>
<LI>Repeat step 6 to install gfarm on all compute nodes. <font color="red">Note that do NOT use shared file systems for gfarm spool directory.</font>
<p>
<LI>Since Gfarm requires GSI authentication on all nodes, you need to make sure that all site certificate files and grid-mapfile are in synch among front-end and compute nodes. There are many methods can be employed to accomplish that - file replication or common file system or symbolic links etc. - feel free to choose your favorable method.
