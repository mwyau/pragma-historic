Changes between 1.2.0 and 1.2.1:
	Changes to mpiblast:
	- Fixed a memory deallocation bug that caused crashes during result output
	- mpiblast now prints "No hits found" for all queries without results at
	  the end of a query set.  Previously if a query file had no results
	  mpiblast would write an empty results file.

	General changes:
	- Added a 1000 fragments patch for the November 2003 NCBI toolbox release
	
	Bugs discovered:
	- Under Windows mpiBLAST may print incorrect alignments for queries which have
	  a large number (e.g. > 100) of results.  mpiBLAST prints the following error 
	  message when this occurs:  
	  "Error: Timed out waiting for biosequence from workers"
	  This problem can be avoided by setting a more restrictive E-value cutoff
	  using the -e command line option.
	  This behavior has not been observed under Linux.

Changes between 1.1.1 and 1.2.0:
	New Features:
	- When writing result alignments, mpiBLAST uses the database as 
	  distributed on the worker nodes instead of reading the database
	  from the shared filesystem.  This can result in significant speedups,
	  especially when the file server is slow or loaded.
	- mpiBLAST prints alignments for translated searches (blastx,tblastn,tblastx)
	- Database update functionality.  New sequences can be added to an existing 
	  mpiBLAST database.
	- mpiBLAST has a web interface.  A script to interface mpiBLAST to NCBI's 
	  wwwblast web service has been included.
	- Updated the BLAST functionality to be consistent with the latest NCBI-BLAST
	  release.  mpiBLAST now accepts the -m 10 and -m 11 output format options to
	  write output in text or binary ASN.1 format.  Previously the -O option was 
	  used.
	  
	Fixes to mpiBLAST:
	- Fixed a crash when writing tabular format output (-m 8 and -m 9)
	- Fixed a crash when writing XML format output (-m 7)
	- The --removedb option will now remove the database even if a search is not
	  being performed
	
	General changes:
	- mpiBLAST 1.2.0 requires the April 2003 or later release of NCBI Toolbox
	- getopt1.c is now included in the build for systems lacking getopt_long (AIX)
	- MS Visual Studio 7 .NET projects are now included to assist users who would
	  like to compile mpiBLAST under Windows.
	
Changes between 1.1.0 and 1.1.1:
	General Fixes:
	- mpiblast now correctly looks for the configuration file in the
	  $INSTALL_PREFIX/etc/ directory if it is not at $HOME/.mpiblastrc
	- Fixed text README to reflect that the configuration file only
	  contains two lines
	- mpiblast no longer prints warnings when using databases formatted
	  without indices ( The -o F formatdb option )
	- Numerous compiler-specific compilation error workarounds

	Fixes to mpiformatdb:
	- mpiformatdb directly outputs the database to the destination instead
	  of trying to copy it
	- The gcc 3.x standard c++ library has a large file bug that prevented
	  counting the database size correctly on databases > 2GB.  A
	  workaround using C file I/O was contributed by Cesar Delgado.
	- mpiformatdb does a better job fragmenting the database into the
	  requested number of fragments, thanks to a patch by Jason Gans
	- There is a --decomp option to mpiformatdb that prints APPROXIMATE
	  database sizes based on number of fragments (also by J.D. Gans)

	Fixes to mpiblast:
	- mpiblast now uses MPI_Abort() when exiting on an error condition
	- Several memory leaks were corrected and memory requirements reduced
	  by a patch contributed by Jason Gans

Changes between 1.0.1 and 1.1.0:

	Ported to Windows/mpich-nt
	
	Rewrote mpiformatdb in C++, now it directly links to the NCBI formatdb code.  As a result it is no longer necessary to install the formatdb or BLAST executables, or to specify their location in the mpiBLAST configuration file

	Fixed a file copy bug when formatting protein databases with mpiformatdb
	
	mpiformatdb no longer needs to be run from the directory containing the unformatted database.
	
	The default configuration file semantics have been changed.  Under Unix both mpiblast and mpiformatdb default to ~/.mpiblastrc.  If ~/.mpiblastrc does not exist or the $HOME environment variable is not set then $INSTALL_PREFIX/etc/mpiblast.conf is used, where $INSTALL_PREFIX is the path given to ./configure for your mpiBLAST installation.  If the configuration file is specified on the command line using --config-file the defaults are overriden.

	Under Windows the default configuration file location is %USERPROFILE%\.mpiblastrc.  If %USERPROFILE%\.mpiblastrc does not exist or %USERPROFILE% is not set then mpiBLAST tries %windir%\mpiblast.ini.  As in Unix, the default config file location can be overriden with the --config-file command line argument.

	Some versions of the NCBI toolkit have a bug that causes mpiBLAST to print warning messages about 'taxdb.bti'.  These are harmless.  To eliminate the warning message the following line can be deleted from tools/readdb.c in the NCBI development library.  Of course you will need to recompile after the modification.

Changes between 1.0.0 and 1.0.1:
	Fixed a bug causing a crash when the database was formatted without indexes
	
	Added support for up to 1000 database fragments (see README for details)
	
	Added support for cleaning up local storage of database fragments

	Included GNU getopt in the distribution for compilation on systems such as
AIX and Solaris that do not have getopt_long().

Changes between 0.9.0 and 1.0.0:

Dynamic database distribution:
	This change has many implications.  Database fragments are no longer
distributed when formatting the database with mpiformatdb.  
Instead, database fragments are copied from shared storage to worker nodes as
necessary in order to complete each BLAST search.  Once copied, a fragment
remains on the worker's local storage for use by future searches.

Use of NCBI library to output merged results:
	Previously results were merged with a text file parser.  BLAST results are
now merged by mpiBLAST and output directly using the NCBI library.  As a result,
users can now choose to output BLAST results in most formats supported by NCBI
BLAST, including XML and ASN.1.

Corrected E-value statistics:
	E-values are now adjusted based on the size of the entire database being
searched.

All nucleotide DB fragment index files are now copied to workers correctly

mpiformatdb is now standalone and should be run without mpirun.  This is a
side effect of the dynamic database distribution described above.
