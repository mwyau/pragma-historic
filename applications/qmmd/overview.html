Requirements of the application is <a href="qmmd_requirement.html">here</a>.

<h2>0. PRAGMA/TeraGrid Joint Experiment </h2>
This application will be used for PRAGMA/TeraGrid Joint Experiment.
The detailed information is available on the <a href="http://wiki.pragma-grid.net/index.php?title=PRAGMA/TeraGrid_Joint_Experiment">PRAGMA wiki</a> page.

<h2>1. Application</h2>
The application is a multiscale simulation that seamlessly embeds
accurate quantum mechanical (QM) calculation to handle chemical
reactions (below a length scale of 10^-8 m) within a molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation to describe large-scale atomistic processes
(up to a length scale of 10^-6 m).  Modern design of high-performance
materials and devices focuses on controlling structures at diverse
length scales from atomic to macroscopic, and such multiscale MD/QM
simulations are expected to play an important role in scaling down
engineering concepts to nanometer scales.

<h2>2. Implementation</h2>
We have implemented a multiscale MD/QM simulation scheme, in which
atomic clusters described by QM calculation are embedded in an
atomistic region.  The motion of atoms is described with a real-space
multigrid-based DFT in the QM clusters and with the MD approach in the
surrounding region.  To make the MD/QM simulation scalable and
adaptive to a Grid, we have implemented the simulation based on a
divide-and-concur scheme in which the QM region is a union of multiple
QM clusters.  Each QM cluster calculation does not access the atomic
coordinates in the other clusters and accordingly its parallel
implementation involves no inter-QM cluster communication.  The hybrid
MD/QM simulation has been implemented using GridRPC and MPI.  GridRPC
is a programming model based on a Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
mechanism tailored for the Grid.  MPI is used for extracting inner
parallelism from both MD and QM calculations and GridRPC is used for
calling QM calculations on clusters.  GridRPC frees us from burden of
Grid-enabled MPI such as co-allocation, weak fault tolerance, etc.  We
used Ninf-G version 2 (Ninf-G2) as a GridRPC programming middleware.
Ninf-G2 is a reference implementation of the GridRPC API, a proposed
GGF standard.  Ninf-G2 is implemented to work with basic Grid
services, such as GSI, GRAM, and MDS in the Globus Toolkit version 2.
Hiding the complexity of the Globus Toolkit, Ninf-G enables easy
development and execution of Grid applications.

<h2>3. Experiments and demonstration (planned)</h2>
We plan to run the multiscale simulation on PRAGMA testbed as a sample
application of PRAGMA routine-basis experiment.  The simulation has a
capability for fault-tolerant.  If a cluster becomes unavailable, the
simulation which has been running on the cluster will be migrated to
the other cluster.  Using this capability, we plan to continue the
simulation for about 1 month without interrupting its execution.
