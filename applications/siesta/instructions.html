Installation instructions for SIESTA and the auxiliary ATOM program.

A) SIESTA

After unpacking the Siesta (tarred and gzipped) archive:

* Go to Src and type:

  configure --enable-fast

(that will generate a file named 'arch.make' with basic compiler flags, and the location
of the basic libraries. If you know where to find optimized BLAS and LAPACK libraries,
you can use

  configure --enable-fast   --with-blas=/path/to/libblas.a --with-lapack=/path/to/liblapack.a

* Type "make" to compile the program.

* Now go to the Src/Tests/h2o directory and type "make".

  The test should run to completion (in a short time), and the results should be similar (to within
  numerical roundoff error propagation) to the Reference/h2o.out file:

  diff h2o.out ../Reference/h2o.out

* The siesta executable can now be put in some standard place where I can find it.

NB: If the configure process fails for some reason, you can use one of the pre-cooked arch.make files
in the Src/Sys directory. Select (or create) an appropriate file and put it in the Src directory with
the name "arch.make". Then do the "make" step.

B) ATOM

* Go to the Pseudo/atom directory and type

  make FC="compiler_name" 

  where "compiler_name" is the compiler you are using.  For example:

  make FC=g95

* The atm executable can now be put in some standard place where I can find it.
