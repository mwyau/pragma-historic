Subject: Report after PRAGMA12

Dear all, especially those could not make to PRAGMA12, 
Sorry for the belated report. 
We had another successful and fun PRAGMA meeting! Thanks for the hard work and thoughtfulness of our PRAGMA fellows at NECTEC and ThaiGrid, Joe, Putchong, Sornthep, Somsak and Sugree and many others! 
The theme of PRAGMA12 was The Fellowship Of The Grid. We discovered who are the The Two Towers, The Return Of The King and many professional-grade singers and dancers among PRAGMA fellows! J
We rejoiced with old friends and had a good time with many new friends from Australia, China, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. See
