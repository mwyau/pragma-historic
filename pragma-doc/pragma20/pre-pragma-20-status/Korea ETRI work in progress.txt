Dear Joongsoo,
 
I have added your ssh key in my authorized_keys file on fiji.rocksclusters.org.
You can ssh to zhengc@fiji.rocksclusters.org.
 
There are 2 VM images in vm-backup directory: rocks-185.hda.gz and afg-rocks-184.hda.gz.
Both are Rocks 5.3 with the following rolls: base, os, area51, hpc, service pack, sge, web-server.
The VM image is simply the hard disk image for the head node of the virtual cluster.
Additional software installed are:
 
rocks-185.hda.gz: 
========== 
VDT, globus, intel compilers
 
afg-rocks-184.hda.gz: 
========== 
VDT, globus, intel compilers, MyProxy 
(This system was built using rocks-185.hda image and it's for Avian Flu Grid applications.
 
You can find more details about how the VM systems was built and 
about the experiments we are working on with these VM images at 
http://goc.pragma-grid.net/wiki/index.php/Rocks_VM.
 
Let me know if you need anything else.
Looking forward to learn about your analysis!
 
Cindy

Subject: Asking to access VM images
Dear Ms. Cindy Zheng,

This is Joongsoo Lee. I am working for ETRI, Daejeon, Korea.

I really appreciate allowing me to access VM images in PRAGMA. To make a good evaluation we 
are trying to gather VM images as many as possible. We will not analyze user’s data for any 
purpose. 

However, some metadata is very helpful to make an analysis on the experimental result. The 
metadata is as follows;
1) OS type
2) VM image format 
3) Application area (DB, Web, etc.)
4) Installed software

If I am allowed to access metadata that I described above, I want to gather these information.

Here is my public key.

Thank you very much for your help.
