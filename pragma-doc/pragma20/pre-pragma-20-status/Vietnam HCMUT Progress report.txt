I'm fine. Thanks. 
 
In the last year, the Supernode2 system was used mostly for the VN-Grid project (some further 
information, the documents are in Vietnamese though) and its sub-projects such as: 
. PCB design 
. Airplane aerodynamic using CFD 
. Parallel Tempering Monte Carlo investigation of melting KCl 
The system was also used by students doing their dissertations and by Department of Applied 
Physics, Faculty of Applied Sciences at our university in their researches. 
 
In the next semester, we're adding a SAN to the cluster and will use it more for teaching 
purposes. We're going to try joining our system into PRAGMA system, again. This will be done 
after the Lunar New Year vacation around mid Feb. So I expect it to be up and running around 
beginning of March. 
 
Regards,

Dear Thuan N. Tran,
 
How are you?
I see that Tran Vu Pham has registered for PRAGMA 20 and will present VN-grid work.
I want to make sure to include works and plans at all sites in our summary.
Please make sure to email me a brief summary before Monday, so I can include in our progress report.
 
Thank you very much,
 
Cindy

Hello Miss Cindy, 
 
I'm the current contact and also the administrator of Supernode 2 cluster. As Mr. Son already 
mentioned, currently our system is under reorganization and we also having some problem with 
the cooling system in the cluster room, thus we're down to only a handful of nodes. These nodes 
are currently dedicated to the VN-Grid project, which is near completion, for testing our 
middleware. With these streaks of events, it's unfortunate but we have to prioritize our work 
over here. As soon as the cooling system is backed up, I will restore the system and open access 
to the cluster to the public again. I'm sorry for any inconvenience. 
 
P.S. I have received the email from the PRIME students asking permission to use the cluster 
some time ago. I answered them pretty much the same.

Dear Thuan N. Tran and Tran Dang Khoa, 
 
I'm not sure which one of you are the current contact. 
I'm having trouble to access supernode2 cluster. 
See some of my test results below. 
Could you check your host certificate and my account setup? 
Also PRIME students needs accounts on your cluster. 
Please see item 3 and 4 in 
http://goc.pragma-grid.net/pragma-doc/userguide/updatelog.html. 
You want to also make sure that item 1 is done. 
Let me know if I can be of any help.
