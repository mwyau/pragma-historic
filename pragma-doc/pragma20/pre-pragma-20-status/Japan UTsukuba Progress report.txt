Dear Cindy,

Sorry for the very late reply.

We announced the version 2.4.1 on December 30, 2010.  It supports automatic file replica creation.  The 
number of file replicas can be specified by the extended attribte gfarm.ncopy of the ancient directory.  
Gfarm samba plugin is also available, which enables Windows clients to access a Gfarm file system.

Hadoop Gfarm plugin shows comparative performance with the HDFS. Data in the Gfarm file system can 
be shared and accessed by POSIX applications, MPI-IO application, and Hadoop MapReduce applications.

Best regards,
Osamu
