Worth noting that we ran a series of HD video seminars from NCSA during semester II. 

We currently have 4 MURPA students at UCSD/CalIT2 (working with Jurgen Schultze, Sameer Tilak, Ilkay 
Altintas and Wilfred Li) and 2 students @ NCSA (working with Radha Nandkumar and Bill Gropp).

Blair and Santiago will report on the volcano work - we published a paper in IEEE e-Science on this. (See 
below)

Yep I'd say so. I don't think there's anything more to add from me since the PRAGMA brochure. Santiago 
has updated the Suzuki model code some I believe, and is working on another part of the project. My 
understanding is that we are still working towards a Nimrod/K work-flow that links all the bits together...

Blair, Santiago

We (i.e. you :-) could report something about our work since - I guess the IEEE e-Science publication is 
the most significant deliverable.
