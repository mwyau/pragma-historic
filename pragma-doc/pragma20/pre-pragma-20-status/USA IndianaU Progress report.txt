Hi Cindy,   here's a slight edit to Yuan's writeup with some future plans as well.  beth

The Opal web service toolkit is designed to make the deployment of existing applications as web 
services easy. It leverages, for instance, the Globus GRAM for job submission, requires a simple 
configuration file for the location of the application, and supports command line options as 
required. Sigiri is web service that provides a uniform abstraction layer over heterogeneous 
compute resources.  In this demonstration the Indiana University team shows interoperability of 
Opal and Sigiri where Opal instead of submitting jobs to Globus GRAM, submits to Sigiri 
instead.  This is useful in a PRAGMA testbed because it could be used to enlist cloud resources, 
for instance, as fallback when PRAGMA testbed resources are exceeded.  In future efforts we 
hope to deploy our provenance collection tool, Karma, to our PRAGMA testbed nodes.

Hi Cindy,
 
Thanks. We setup PRAGMA testbed nodes at Indiana University in the form of a 4-node virtual 
cluster hosting servers. These dedicated servers equipped with a Dual AMD 2.0GHz Opteron 
and 16GB memory on each node. The latest version of Rocks OS(v5.4) is installed, together with 
the Xen roll. We also have AFG VC disk image (rocks-184 image downloaded from 
fiji.rocksclusters.org) loaded. We are currently in the stage of setting up our own CA. Will let 
you know when it's done.
 
Here's the work we are going to present.

Hi, Luo Yuan, 
 
I see that you will be presenting some of your work at PRAGMA 20. 
Congratulations for the accomplishment! 
I'd like to include them and any other works/plans at IU in our progress 
report. 
So, please email me a brief summary - a few sentences will do. 
 
Looking forward to see you at PRAGMA 20! 
 
Cindy
