Dear Miss Cindy Zheng,
Thank for your e-mail.

I try several brief about our works on grid computing, so you can include in the report you are doing:
Last year, after PRAGMA 10/2009 we had deployed 2 project:
1. Link to PRAGMA and we are became as the member of PRAGMA.
2. We had created one Project on GRID Computing, the VNGRID, as the State project to link IOIT at 
Hanoi with several Universities in Vietnam:
University of Technology Hanoi, University of Nature Sciences Hanoi, EIC Company. The grid is using for 
Forecast problems, Bio applications and encryption/de-cryption problems.
3. In this year we plan to study the Grid+Cloud computing. This is the project of IOIT Hanoi.

Thank you for help to us.
Several days next is the New traditional year in Vietnam and so in China, so BEST WISH to you and your 
family.
HTC.
