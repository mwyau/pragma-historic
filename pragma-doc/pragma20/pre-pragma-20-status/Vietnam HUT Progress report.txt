Dear Cindy 
First of all, wish you all the happiness and success in the new year 2011 and hope that we will 
also cooperate more in the Tan Mao year ! (follow the asia's calendar) 
In the past year, we have deployed two projects Goodas and Linda. Because we don't have 
enough human resources for Goodas project so we must stop this project. About Linda, we are 
developing a new version for Linda, called LindaX. The basic difference between Linda and 
LindaX is clear separation between grid layer and application layer. Grid only provide the 
services and doesn't care about layer below.  
We focus on improving interface for two basic services download and upload, create new 
features such as Flie Manager for Grid Data with Drag and Drop, View as tree, v.v.. Back Up 
and Data Synchronization. Our first test of LindaX is expected to run at the end of June. 
 
Thanks you so much and happy lunar new year :)

Dear Le Duc Tung and Quang Minh,
 
How are things going with you? 
Wish you all the happiness and success in the new year!
 
I'm trying to summarize works and plan of all PRAGMA grid sites on Monday.
Would like to include HUT's effort.
Could you email me a few sentences to summarize works and plan?
 
Thank you very much,
 
Cindy

Dear Cindy 
 
Now we have two PRAGMA-related projects are Linda and GOODAS. In this moment, we are 
in the process personnel changes for these projects so both of them do not have the desired 
results. 
 
About GOODAS, it has developed successfully on virtual grid (make by ourself) and is in the 
process of deploying on gird. As we said above, we are reorganizing personnel for this job. 
 
About Linda: we initially deployed to the grid and we've done. Now we've researched about 
program using grid service by Java Cog Kit. Linda is a data sharing system based on grid, we 
developed successfully modules such as management proxy module, management data module, 
control file transfer speed module and so on for our system. 
 
What's not clear if in this letter, please mail to me or Le Duc Tung :) 
 
Thanks you so much!

Dear Dao Quang Minh 
 
I'm trying to summarize our work and send out Monday. 
Could you help and let me know your application status/plan? 
Or any other PRAGMA-related projects going on or planned. 
So I can include in the summary. 
 
Thank you very much in advance,
 
Cindy

               Dear Dao Quang Minh, 
               Could you check the reference link in your application page? 
               It got 404 error when I click on it. 
               Thanks, 
               Cindy

                       The page looks good. 
 
                       Let me know when you finish testing user setup to

                       Whence confirmed that there is no problem, I'll ask

                               Dear Cindy, 
 
                               Thanks for your guide, let me clarify 
                               About hardware, our application can run on 
both of x86_64 and 686 system. X86_64 system is better but 686 system is 
enough for us. So I have removed requirement line about cpu architecture. 
                               About software requirements, I have fixed in 
http://goc.pragma-grid.net/wiki/index.php/Grid_Oriented_Online_Document_Anal 
ysing_System follow your guide. 
 
                               Thank you so much ! 
 
 
                               2010/1/22 Cindy Zheng <zhengc@sdsc.edu> 
 
 
                                       Dear Dao Quang Minh, 
 
                                       Thank you for setting up the 
application page! 
 
                                       Just need to clarify a couple of 
things: 
 
                                       About the hardware requirements, 
                                       does your application ONLY run on 
x86_64 systems? 
                                       We have very few x86_64 systems in 
PRAGMA grid. 
                                       See 
http://goc.pragma-grid.net/pragma-doc/computegrid.html. 
                                       Notice that bkluster (HUT node in 
PRAGMA grid) is a i686 system. 
                                       Majority of PRAGMA grid systems are 
i686. 
                                       Let me know, so I know which systems 
will need to create your account. 
 
                                       About software requirements, 
                                       for each software that requires site 
admin to install, 
                                       please document it folow the 
instructions/examples at 
 
http://goc.pragma-grid.net/wiki/index.php/Application_Document_Guideline_and 
                                       _Template. 
                                       If you don't know any such software 
at this time, you can leave it blank. 
                                       If you know that none is required, 
please put "None". 
                                       This is to avoid any confusion to 
site admins. 
 
                                       Thanks again, 
 
                                       Cindy
