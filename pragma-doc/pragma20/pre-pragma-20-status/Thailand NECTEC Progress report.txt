Dear Cindy,

  For NECTEC, we continue working on 2 projects as follows.

(i) Simulation of Coastal Changes project which aims to discover in- depth knowledge of coastal 
sediment transport and coastal processes in the gulf of Thailand. Currently, we study the storm surge 
mechanism in the gulf of Thailand by focusing on the effect of meteorological and hydrological forcing 
on storm surge hydrodynamic process. The interaction of tide and surge in the gulf of Thailand are 
characterized using the simulation results together with hydrological and geographic information data.

(ii) In the Environment Informatorium project which we have introduced a Web-based Portal to be 
served as a one stop service for service discovery across multiple Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) 
service repositories.
We currently develop the Service Registry which allows service providers to register their services for 
the service consumers to search and browse for the required services through automatic service 
retrieval.

Looking forward to seeing you soon,
Ekasit K.
