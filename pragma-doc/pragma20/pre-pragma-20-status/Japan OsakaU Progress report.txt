Dear Cindy-san,


Sorry for the late replay.


Here is the brief summary of our work.


Situation:

We have designed and been prototyping a solution that combines seamlessly the Rocks installation 
mechanism with overlay technology that allows scientists to easily build virtual clusters over multiple 
physical clusters (i.e. multi-site virtual cluster). We have verified that we can manually build a multi-site 
virtual cluster with our solution.


On going work:

We are working on the implementation for the automation of the proposed solution in the Rocks toolkit. 
We are coding some original rocks commands which enable administrators to build multi-site virtual 
clusters by similar manner to building Rocks virtual clusters.



If you have any question, let me know. :-)


Sincerely yours,

Kei.
