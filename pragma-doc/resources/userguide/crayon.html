<LI>Resource information
<br>
SDSC is providing a Linux cluster, called rocks-52.
<br>
Rocks-52 is a 15-nodes Linux Cluster whose interconnection is Giga-bit Ethernet. Each node has 4 Xeon 3.06GHz and 4GB memory. Users' home directories are shared among all nodes by NFS.
<br>
On rocks-52, the Globus gatekeeper is running on User Service Nodes and computing nodes can be utilized via the Globus jobmanager (jobmanager-sge).
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Rocks-52
<br>
  Rocks-52 is available to users and projects approved by PRAGMA resources group.

<LI>Resource Reservation
<br>
Rocks-52 is intended to be used for development and testing of Grid middleware and Grid applications in PRAGMA.
<p>
You must apply exclusive use at least three business days before you intend to use rocks-52.  Please send your application to <a href="mailto:crayon-admin@sdsc.edu">crayon-admin</a>. The application should indicate
<UL>
<LI>Your name
<LI>Your account
<LI>Number of CPUs/nodes which you would like to occupy
<LI>the start time / end time (time zone must be indicated)
<br>
(you are allowed to occupy, at most, 24 hours for benchmarking)
<LI>the purpose of the experiments
</UL>
<p>
Your application will be reviewed by the administrators and you will be notified of the decision within a few business days of your application.
<br>
SDSC will announce the schedule of the reservation via the users mailing list (crayon-users@sdsc.edu).
<br>
SDSC will provide the dedicated resources during the specified (or permitted) period. Other users will not be able to use (login) the dedicated resources during the period.
<p>
<LI>Installation of additional software
<br>
SDSC clusters can be used for R&D of Grid middleware and applications. 
You can install, test and evaluate your software on SDSC clusters. 
Since SDSC clusters are shared by many users, you are requested to test and debug your software thoroughly before installing it on SDSC clusters so that it will not damage the systems. 
If you need supervisor privilege for installing your software, please contact the support staff.
