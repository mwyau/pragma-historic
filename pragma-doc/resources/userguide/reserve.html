<font size="+1">
Some special events may require dedicated resources
among certain sites in PRAGMA testbed. Before we have a
meta-scheduler to handle reservations automatically, we
will try to follow a tentative manual procedure as below.
<p>
To keep things simple, we will dedicate resources at
cluster level - which means that if a site decided to
allow a cluster be used in a dedicated run, all nodes 
in the cluster should be made available to the dedicated 
run during the scheduled time. As how to accomplish this,
each site is free to implement their own way. For those
sites who like to know what's been done and worked, 
AIST has used a very simple and effective way on their 
clusters - make an alternate passwd file to include only 
the dedicated user (of course, all system accounts) and switch the passwd file during the 
dedicated time.

<p>
Here are the steps:
<OL>
   <LI>Testing for access and application requirements on candidate clusters should be done before the dedicated run time
<LI>Requester sends a request to <a href="mailto:zhengc@sdsc.edu">PRAGMA Grid administrator</a>
   <UL>
   <LI>Spedify the purpose and the application for the dedicated run
   <LI>Specify the desired dates of the reservation
   <LI><strong>Must</strong> name each cluster you wish to be reserved
   <LI>The request <strong>must be made at least 10 days before the reservation starting date</strong>
   <LI>Minor change to the request <strong>must be made at least 48 hours before the reservation starting date</strong>
   <LI>Any major change to the request will need to go through the approval process as a brand new request</strong>
   </UL>
<LI>The PRAGMA Grid administrator forwards the request to the named sites administrators within 24 hours.
<LI>Each site will decide on approve or reject, and should notify the <a href="mailto:zhengc@sdsc.edu">PRAGMA Grid administrator</a> of their decision <strong>at least 5 days before the reservation starting date</strong>.
<LI>The PRAGMA Grid administrator then inform the requester about the response from the sites and fix a schedule.
<LI>The PRAGMA Grid administrator then email to pragma-grid-admin list, inform all application drivers and site administrators the scheduled duration, reserved sites and the application driver for the dedicated run
<LI>One or two days before the reservation time, the PRAGMA Grid administrator will remind all application drivers and site administrators about this resource dedication.
<LI>When the dedication time comes, the administrators of the dedicated sites should make the resources available for the dedicated user
<LI>When the reservation period is over, or when the dedicated run is done before the dedicated ending time, the driver of the dedicated run should inform pragma-grid-admin list that the dedicated use is over.
<LI>The administrators of the dedicated sites should open-up these dedicated resources to all PRAGMA testbed users again.
</OL>
