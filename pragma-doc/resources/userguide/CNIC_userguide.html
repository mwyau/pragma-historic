</p></li><li>Resource information
<br>
CNIC is providing a Linux cluster, called CNIC Grid Testbed with the hostname pragma.sdg.ac.cn.
<br>CNIC Grid Testbed is a 8-nodes Linux Cluster whose interconnection is
Quodrix Network. Each node has 4 IaitumnII 1.3GHz and 8GB memory. Users'
home directories are shared among all nodes by NFS.
<br>On CNIC Grid Testbed, the Globus gatekeeper is running on User Service
Nodes and computing nodes can be utilized via the Globus jobmanager
(jobmanager).

permitted) period. Other users will not be able to use (login) the
dedicated resources during the period.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Installation of additional software
<br>CNIC Grid Testbed can be used for R&amp;D of Grid middleware and
applications. You can install, test and evaluate your software on CNIC 
Grid Testbed. Since CNIC Grid Testbed are shared by many users, you are
requested to test and debug your software thoroughly before installing
it on CNIC Grid Testbed so that it will not damage the systems. If you need
supervisor privilege for installing your software, please contact the
support staff.
