Hi Cindy,

We haven't been using PRAGMA Grid resources routinely in these few years.
But I think the use of NCHC and SDSC resources after the earthquake in March 11 can be considered as a 
part of PRAGMA activities.
It's up to Peter if this will be included or not.

Activities by GEO Grid Disaster Response Task Force.
After the earthquake on March 11, AIST faced a problem to provide GEO Grid's services due to lack of 
resources.  From April 21, GEO Grid started providing services using SDSC and NCHC's resources.
A part of the services and results are provided on the following web
site:
http://disaster-e.geogrid.org/

> -          Codes, hardware used

Codes:
- Quick Estimation System for Earthquake Maps (QuakeMap)
  http://qq.ghz.geogrid.org/QuakeMap/index.en.html
- Processing of ASTER (satellite) data
- WMS server providing satellite data

Hardware:
NCHC's Naruto cluster : 16+1 nodes
    CPU : 4-core 2.0 GHz Intel Xeon E5335 * 2 (8 cores/node)
    Memory : total 32*16 GB = 512GB
    Disk : 2TB
    interconnect : DDR InfiniBand +1GE

SDSC's Triton

These resources are being used routinely.

We have some Japanese publications, but no English publications at this moment.  Sorry...

Any comments and questions are welcome.
