Subject:	application on PRAGMA cluster

Dear Cindy,

Dr. Nam just forwarded your mail to me requesting brief report on application of
PRAGMA clusters. Here below is some, and if you need more, please feel free
to contact me.

1. Star3D: this is a three-dimensional Euler solver using finite volume method on 
   multiblock structured grid. The application is developed by a research group
   in Department of Aeronautical Engineering, Faculty of Transportation.
   
   Code: GNU Fortran 90, developed for Intel-based system. The code has been
   tested on SuperNodeII cluster of Intel-based computers.

   Result & publications:
   - T.T. Tinh, D.T. Son, N.A. Thi, "Development of three dimensional Euler solver using
     finte volume method on multiblock structured grid, submitted to proceedings of
    "4th International conference on High Performance Scientific Computing", 3-6 Mar 2009,
    Hanoi, Vietnam.
 
2. Genetic Algorithm with artificial neural network (ANN) for aerodynamic shape optimization. 
This is a 
   joint-work between Department of Aeronautical Engineering and High Performance Scientific
    Computing group at Faculty of Computer Science & Engineering. CFD simulation
    using Star3D is applied to estimate the fitness function within a GA framework. In
    addition, ANN is also incorporated into the framework to reduce the very time-consuming
     CFD simulation (normally take 7 hours of sequential simulation).
 
   Code: GNU C++, Fortran 90. developed for Intel-based system. The code has been
   tested on SuperNodeII cluster of Intel-based computers.

   Result & publications: 
   - T.Q. Khai, T.V. Hoai, N.A. Thi, "Application of online-trained ANN and parallel computing 
in 
     2D Airfoil optimization", submitted to ACOMP2011 - International Conference on Advanced
     Computing and Applications, 19-21 Oct 2011, Ho Chi MInh City, Vietnam.

Hope those information helpful to you.

Best regards, 
Hoai
