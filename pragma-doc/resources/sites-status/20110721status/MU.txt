Hi Cindy,

I'm ridiculously stretched for time as it is sorry, so this is going to be brief.

I think we already reported on last year's PRIME students, right?

To be honest I don't think I've run anything on PRAGMA-Grid in the last year, the overhead of 
application deployment, execution debugging and so forth is too high to justify when most sites only 
offer very limited resources, maybe the cloud can help here. :-P

But we should count PRAGMA affiliated work running locally too...

Our 2011 PRIME students (Jenny, Jerry and Andy) are all running sweeps or optimisations via Nimrod on 
Monash and possibly other clusters. I don't have any titles or abstracts of their work though, I'd suggest 
asking them directly, unless David has something? Jenny is looking at optimal pacemaker lead 
placement for damaged hearts, using Continuity to model the mechanics and electrophysiology with 
Nimrod sweeping across placement scenarios. Jerry is trying to figure out where calcium channels are in 
cardiac myocytes (I think) using the package Subcell and Nimrod sweeping across possible scenarios. 
Andy is looking for possible therapeutic drug treatments for some disease (can't remember what), I 
think the rough approach is to identify similar proteins and drugs that act on them, then looks at binding 
potentials with further simulations.

We did some work on NG-TEPHRA, with Santiago, presented at e-Science 2010. See 
http://messagelab.monash.edu.au/Publications/EScience2010Nunez
for abstract and reference. That used the Monash East cluster and Amazon EC2, via Nimrod/G. The 
important thing to note there is that that work grew from initial discussions at the PRAGMA workshop 
and meetings at UCSD.

David, can you think of anything else?

Hope that helps,
~Blair
