Subject:	Re: applications run in last 12 months

Dear Cindy,

At UZH the applications include DOCK6,  a docking  application release by the UCSF.

The features of DOCK 6 include: additional scoring options during minimization; DOCK 3.5 scoring-
including Delphi electrostatics, ligand conformational entropy corrections, ligand desolvation, receptor 
desolvation; Hawkins-Cramer-Truhlar GB/ SA solvation scoring with optional salt screening; PB/SA 
solvation scoring; and AMBER scoring-including receptor flexibility, the full AMBER molecular mechanics 
scoring function with implicit solvent, conjugate gradient minimization, and molecular dynamics 
simulation capabilities.

This program was run by the prime students and if there are any reports/publications  it should have 
been referenced in the last year results. I do not have any record of prime students reports, sorry.

Hardware is Intel, Intel(R) Xeon(TM) 2 CPU 2.80 GHz / 2 GB RAM and
Intel(R) Xeon(R) 2 CPU 1.60 GHz / 2 GB RAM Cluster management is rocks 5.3

Please let me know what else is needed.
Nadya
