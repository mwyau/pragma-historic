Hi Cindy,

I set up an Autodock Virtual Screening web service here http://oolitevm.calit2.optiputer.net:8080/opal2/dashboard?command=serviceList

The Autodock VS web service uses CSF as the scheduler and rocks-184 as a remote host.  Right now we just have one remote hosts, but if we had more, then we can run jobs on different remote hosts concurrently.

I don't know if you are familiar with Autodock VS, but basically one of the inputs is a set of ligand files, and each sub-job will deal with one of the ligand files.  So on rocks-184 each compute node runs one autodock job (one for each ligand file).

There seems to be a little bug somewhere in one of my scripts, but I do get all correct outputs on the remote server.  I expect to fix this little problem soon.

Thanks
Jane
