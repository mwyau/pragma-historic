Hi Cindy,

We keep providing compute resources (SAKURA cluster) and storage resources (gfsd node over Lustre fs).  For former one, we plan to switch it to virtual machine based resources.  We are now trying the Rock's VM roll to confirm if it satisfies both users'
and operators' requirements.  For VM replication, I guess you and Yoshio may have some communications but I don't know much about the plan and status.

For data resources, I really don't know who is using it now.
If someone uses and gives some requests, we are willing to arrange the resources as much as we can.

I don't know much about GEO related project.  I hope you already got the information from Yoshio or Naotaka.

Thanks,
