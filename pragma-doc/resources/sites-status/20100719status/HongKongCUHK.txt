Dear Cindy,

Thanks very much for your message and the reminder.

I may not be able to come (still need to wait for a family schedule) but my teammate Jimmy is trying to, as he would like to pick up some ideas on the CS4 and cluster gateway, so in case we could not meet, please do help me to take care of him and I shall see you at HK the next PRAGMA workshop.

Take care and my best regards
