Hi Cindy,

I'm guessing David is planning on replying to this but in brief for me, the major items are:
- currently have a batch of PRIME students with us doing various projects involving use of Nimrod Toolkit to do distributed processing;
- working with Santiago Nuñez-Corrales et al. from Costa Rica on volcanic ash dispersion modelling on grid and cloud resources with Nimrod tools.

Cheers,
~Blair
