<DIV style="FONT-FAMILY: Courier; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Hi 
Cindy,<BR><BR>Thank you for the advanced greeting and also for providing the 
website links.<BR><BR>Finally, we are going to formally launch the Philippine 
e-Science Grid. This is long overdue and we are very glad that after so many 
drawbacks we were finally able to link one of our clusters to other clusters 
owned by two local universities .&nbsp; These three clusters form the Philippine 
e-Science Grid core.<BR><BR>We have several clusters that are operational right 
now.&nbsp; Next goal is to connect these machines into one virtual cluster, and 
finally to connect this virtual machine to PRAGMA Grid.&nbsp; We plan to do this 
immediately after the launching.&nbsp; As much as possible, we don't want to 
mess up the setup of our clusters now since we will show a lot of demos during 
the launching.&nbsp; We are also looking forward to working with you on 
VM.&nbsp; We are hoping that we could accommplish something significant on this 
aspect before the next PRAGMA meeting.<BR><BR>Best

project<BR><BR>Dear Grace,<BR><BR>I heard from Peter that ASTI is getting ready 
to launch Phillipine grid<BR>project.<BR>That's a great news! You must been very 
busy working on this!<BR>Congratulations for the accomplishment!<BR><BR>Peter 
was also asked to help showing ASTI-PRAGMA collaborations for your <BR>launching 
event and would like to report as much progress as possible.<BR>I know that your 
group has been working on clusters and Rocks VM servers <BR>and planned to join 
PRAGMA grid.<BR>Is there any system ready and can join PRAGMA grid 
now?<BR><BR>To join a cluster (physical or virtual) to PRAGMA grid, 
see<BR>http://goc.pragma-grid.net/pragma-doc/userguide/join.html.<BR><BR>We can 
also start collaborations on VM projects.<BR>See some of the VM work 
done/on-going at 
<BR>http://goc.pragma-grid.net/wiki/index.php/Virtualization.<BR><BR>Let me know 
what I can do to help.<BR><BR>Cindy<BR><BR><BR><BR>-- <BR>
