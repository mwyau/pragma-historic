Hi Cindy,

Sorry for the delayed response.

We released the version 2.3.2 on July 1, and the version 2.4.0 on July 22.  The version 2.3.2 is the most stable version and it supports automatic replica creation.  The version 2.4.0 is a major update that supports update-based replica consistency management that keeps the number of file replicas.  We do not ensure complete backward compatibility for the version 2.4.0.
For incremental update, we suggest the version 2.3.2.

Thanks,
Osamu
