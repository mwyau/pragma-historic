Subject: Progress since PRAGMA 18, plans toward PRAGMA 19

Dear all,

Thanks for everyone's diligent work and status/plan reports, 
I'm very happy to learn that a lot of progress have been made 
since PRAGMA 18!
We are only less than 2 months away from PRAGMA 19!
Please plan your time wisely in order to accomplish all the 
goals set for PRAGMA 19.

Before I summarize some key projects status and plans 
let me first thank all sites admins who have been 
working year afater year, to maintain and improve 
their site systems and to help users to use PRAGMA grid!
Now, here is a short content list, then the list of brief summaries.
Everyone, please feel free to add and correct.

Brief summary
=============

Applications
------------
1. ITCR, Costa Rica team and Monash, Australia team have 
been working together and completed 100K simulations of 
volcanic ash dispersion modelling using Nimrod and PRAGMA 
grid and cloud resources. A paper resulted from the work 
has been accepted by FCST2010, China. The teams are 
currently working on benchmarking of clustered and cloud 
resources, and plan to run 4.5 million scenarios simlation 
with EC2 and EAST, and to develop quantum chemistry 
simulation application. 
2. Uchile team has successfully completed the porting of 
CATT-BRAMS application in PRAGMA grid.
3. HongKong University Mechanical Engineering research 
group is working on a Large-Eddy Simulation of urban air 
pollutant transports and dispersion.
4. KISTI, Korea e-AIRS application (utilize PRAGMA grid 
resources) are used by 7 classes in 3 universities. 
KISTI team is working to globalize e-AIRS to Japan and UK.
5. KISTI and NCSA teams are working together and developing 
a KISTI-NCSA Science Gateway, to provide a user-friendly 
enviroment for building stand-alone HPC applications and 
using HPC resources. 
https://wiki.ncsa.illinois.edu/display/KNSG/SAGE+Documentation.
6. As a part of Korea Lake Ecological Observatory Network 
and in collaboration with GLEON, KISTI and Kangwon University 
teams worked to connect data resources, develop data management, 
sensor and sampling applications.
7. CNIC has released Conference Service Platform (CSP) 
(Duckling version2.0 - based) and deployed/supports PRAGMA19.
8. Lanzhou University is working on a new application - 
Exploring membrane transport mechanisms using molecular 
dynamics simulations (NAMD based).
9. Hanoi University of Technology team is working on 2 
applications: Linda and GOODAS.
10. NECTEC team has successfully simulated typhone Linda
and tidal processes and also built a web portal to serve
both environmental information providers and consumers.

Infrastructure
--------------
1. SDSC/AIST/NBCR continue their virtualization research effort. 
SDSC and NBCR worked together and setup a VM for Avian Flu Grid 
application. This VM has been replicated and tested succefully 
within the same VM hosting server. The procedure is documented 
at http://goc.pragma-grid.net/wiki/index.php/VC-replication-3. 
AIST and NBCR are working on replicate the Avian Flu Grid VM to
their Rocks VM hosting servers. 
AIST is also working on virtual cluster evaluation, very fast 
live-migration of VM images, cloud security and high-performance 
GSI, etc. 
NARL/NCHC is working on virtualization research: use WebOS to 
generate and customize a VM image that called on-demaned
virtual cluster, also deploy and monitor a virtual cluster.
Our Phillipine team at ASTI plan to join the VM testing soon.
2. AIST/SDSC teams are providing PRAGMA GEO science 
infrastructure for GLEON users to access ASTER data and are 
ready to add more data resources to the system.
3. JLU and NBCR/UCSD teams worked together and installed CSF4
server at UCSD with production access to TeraGrid, PRAGMA grid, 
Amazon EC2 and NBCR Rocks clusters. They also setup a new Opal 
Web services for NAMD, using CSF4 as the metascheduler, and
developed a visual programming workflows that invokes Opal-CSF4 
Web services for NAMD and AutoDock.
4. UTsukuba has released Gfarm 2.3.2 and 2.4.0 in July 2010.
The most stable version 2.3.2 supports automatic replica creation.
The version 2.4.0 is a major update that supports update-based
replica consistency management that keeps the number of file replicas.
SDSC team has setup a 38TB storage and is performing some 
final testing. This storage will be used mainly for PRAGMA and 
Gfarm.
5. Asia GEO Grid Initiative has been accepted and started on 
July 1. The participanting institutions are AIST, NECTEC, 
NARL/NCHC and VAST.
6. ITCR, Costa Rica has completed the building of a TDW, 
plan to upgrade network to Internet2 and connect ITCR resources 
to PRAGMA grid, implement HD visualization.
7. In collaboration with KISTI, Kookmin University team is
continuing Mgrid development, final testing wsrf based services, 
developing Gfarm support, and implemented many new features and 
interfaces to enable users easily utilize PRAGMA grid resources.
8. ASTI, Phillipine team has just successfully launched their 
regional Grid - PSciGrid, and it's working to join PRAGMA grid.
9. Already a PRAGMA grid site, HongKong University team has 
been working on and about to launch their regional grid 
infrastructure, plans to join PRAGMA VOMS and virtualization 
effort in the near future.

Education
---------
Many sites are hosting/advise PRIME students this summer:
Monash University, CNIC, University of Hyderabad, Osaka 
University, NICT, USM, University of Auckland, NARL.

Other PRAGMA activities
-----------------------
1. Jilin University team is working feverishly on PRAGMA 19 
preparation
2. Phil and Cindy visited Lanzhou University in May and 
discussed plans to expand collaborations with LZU.
3. HongKong University is working on early preparation of 
PRAGMA 20

Keep up the good work!
Looking forward to see more success at PRAGMA 19!
