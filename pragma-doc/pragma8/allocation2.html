  Cindy,

  If we want to assign a fixed number of nodes to each app,
  with PBS we only need to setup a queue per app with a limit in the
  number of proecessors available to that queue ( I think
  the parameters are resources_max.nodect and resources_assigned.nodect).
  In fact, if the number of nodes assigned to each app is equal, it
  could be handled with just one queue, putting 1/3 (or 1/4) of the nodes 
  as the limit.

  best regards,

  José Luis
