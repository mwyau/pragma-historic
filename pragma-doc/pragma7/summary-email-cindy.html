<LI>PRAGMA7 reports and documents
<br>
Our first routine-basis experiment was a success!
Thank you for everyone who helped to make it successful!
Yusuke and I represented our group and made a 
<a href="http://pragma-goc.rocksclusters.org/pragma-doc/Lessons_files/frame.htm">presentation</a>.
You can also read the Resources Working Group Break-out 
<a href="http://pragma-goc.rocksclusters.org/pragma-doc/ResourceWGBreakout_files/frame.htm">session1</a> and

<p>
<LI>New sites
<br>
Five more institutions have volunteered to join our grid testbed. They are
<UL>
<LI>Academia Sinica, Taiwan (Dr. Hurng-Chun Lee)
<LI>Universify of Hyderabad, India (Dr. Arun Agarwal)
<LI>Universidad de Chile, Chile ( Dr. Alejandro Jofre)
<LI>Centro de Investigacion Cientifica y de Educacion Superior de Ensenada, Mexico (Dr. Raul Hazas, Dr. Salvador Castaneda)
<LI>Jilin University, China (Dr. Xiaohui Wei)
</UL>
I have made request to add their emails to our resources group list. But
before they are getting added, please include their email addresses for
our discussion.
<p>
<LI>Applications
<br>
Next real application is bio-grid. Our application driver will be
Dr. Hurng-chun Lee, Academia Sinica, Taiwan.
I will create an account for Dr. Lee on crayon, so
Dr. Lee can test remote job submission for bio-grid.
<br>
Dr. Lee will put togather the requirements for bio-grid application and
email to resources group by this Friday.
We then can discuss, find out the qualified sites and
finish implement the requirements by end of October.
<br>
When bio-grid application stablize,
we can run another application - igap over gfarm.
<p>
<LI>User/Admin Guides
<br>
We started our documentation effort in PRAGMA7 meeting.
Each site in PRAGMA testbed should produce and publish
a user guide now. You can use 
<a href="http://www.apgrid.org/testbed/resource/aist/AIST-Cluster-Users-Guide-Sep03.doc">AIST Clusters User Guide</a>
as an example.
Each site should email me their web link of the user guide
by Thursday, so I can make links on pragma-goc.
I will write PRAGMA testbed user guide according to
the info provided by the user guides from all sites.
I will also write a <a href="http://pragma-goc.rocksclusters.org/pragma-doc/userguide/join.htm">preparation guide for new site to join PRAGMA testbed</a>.
<p>
<LI>Monitoring
<br>
APAN has graciously offered to help make a network monitoring page
for PRAGMA testbed.
I will email all PRAGMA testbed sites IP#s to Kento Aida at TITECH. 
<br>We have resolved for now to standardize on SCMSWeb for monitoring. We would
like to urge SCMSWeb developers to add SGE/PBS/LSF support to SCMSWeb.
<p>
<LI>User support
<br>
We want to provide user support thru a ticket system.
Jysoo at KISTI is checking to see if we can use KISTI's ticket
system. I will contact Jysoo for KISTI's decision.
<br>
We will have one technical supporter per site to form the
support group for PRAGMA testbed user support.
<p>
<LI>High Pperformance Grid-shell
<p>
Yusuke Tanimura (AIST) demonstrated the High Performance Grid-shell (GXP) which allows
users easily clean up any unwanted processes on a grid. Prof. Taura will
create its documents and make them available to the public. Yoshio Tanaka
will inform our group when it's ready.
